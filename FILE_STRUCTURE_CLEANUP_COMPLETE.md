## 🔗 Navigation Paths

### From Root
```
README.md → Understand structure
     ↓
Pick your path:
├─→ START_HERE_DOCUMENTATION.md (new user)
├─→ QUICK_NAVIGATION.md (find docs)
├─→ FILE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md (understand layout)
└─→ docs/ (find specific docs)
```

### Common Workflows
```
Getting Started:
README.md → START_HERE_DOCUMENTATION.md → docs/getting-started/

Development:
README.md → QUICK_NAVIGATION.md (your role) → docs/development/

Deployment:
README.md → FILE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md → docs/deployment/

Troubleshooting:
README.md → QUICK_NAVIGATION.md → docs/troubleshooting/
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Bookmark the main README**
   - `README.md` explains the whole structure
   - Reference it when confused about where things go

2. **Use QUICK_NAVIGATION by role**
   - Different paths for different roles
   - Get to the right docs faster

3. **Check folder READMEs**
   - Each folder has a README
   - Explains what's in that folder

4. **Keep archive as reference**
   - Old docs stored there
   - Don't delete, just archive

5. **Run verification after changes**
   - `python utilities/verification/VERIFY_IMPLEMENTATION.py`
   - Confirms everything still works
