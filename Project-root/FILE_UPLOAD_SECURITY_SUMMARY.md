# File Upload Security Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Hard Dependency on python-magic
- ✅ Added `python-magic==0.4.27` to requirements.txt
- ✅ Documented as hard requirement in README
- ✅ No fallback logic - fails fast if missing
- ✅ Removed all try/except imports for python-magic

### 2. Strict File Validation
- ✅ Created `app/utils/file_validation.py`
- ✅ Validates file size (default 10MB limit)
- ✅ Validates MIME type using magic.from_buffer()
- ✅ Whitelisted file types:
  - image/jpeg (magic: `\xff\xd8\xff`)
  - image/png (magic: `\x89PNG`)
  - image/gif (magic: `GIF87a`, `GIF89a`)
  - application/pdf (magic: `%PDF-`)
  - text/csv (special validation)
- ✅ Magic number validation for all non-CSV files
- ✅ Raises ValueError on any validation failure
- ✅ No tuple returns - exceptions only

### 3. Secure File Storage
- ✅ Files stored in `private_uploads/` (outside static/)
- ✅ Unique filenames using UUID + secure_filename
- ✅ File permissions set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✅ Never serve files directly from static routes

### 4. Authenticated File Serving
- ✅ Created `/api/files/<filename>` endpoint with authentication
- ✅ Access control checks:
  - Users can access their own profile pictures
  - Authenticated users can view item images
  - Admin role can access any file
- ✅ Directory traversal protection
- ✅ All access attempts logged

### 5. Comprehensive Logging
- ✅ All validation failures logged with details:
  - User ID
  - Filename
  - MIME type
  - File size
  - Timestamp
  - Rejection reason
- ✅ Successful uploads logged for audit trail
- ✅ File access attempts logged
- ✅ Structured log format for easy parsing

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Created `tests/test_file_validation.py` with 20+ test cases:
  - Valid file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, PDF, CSV)
  - Invalid file types (.exe, .php, .js, .html)
  - Oversized files (>10MB)
  - Magic number mismatches
  - Polyglot files
  - Corrupted files
  - Empty files
  - CSV validation
  - Custom size limits
  - Regression tests for fallback removal

### 7. Virus Scanning (Optional)
- ✅ Created `app/utils/virus_scan.py`
- ✅ ClamAV integration via pyclamd
- ✅ Configurable via `ENABLE_VIRUS_SCAN` environment variable
- ✅ Scans files before saving
- ✅ Automatically deletes infected files
- ✅ Logs all virus detections
- ✅ Created `VIRUS_SCANNING_GUIDE.md` with setup instructions

## Security Features

### ✅ No Fallback Logic
- python-magic import has no try/except fallback
- Application fails immediately if library missing
- No warnings about missing validation - hard failure only

### ✅ Validation Enforcement
- All upload routes call `validate_upload()` before saving
- Validation failures raise ValueError (not returned as tuple)
- File is never saved if validation fails
- User receives clear error message

### ✅ Access Control
- Files never served via static routes
- All file access requires authentication
- Permission checks before serving:
  - Profile pictures: owner or admin only
  - Item images: any authenticated user
- Directory traversal protection
- Real path verification

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Every upload attempt logged (success or failure)
- User ID, filename, MIME, size, timestamp recorded
- File access attempts logged
- Virus detections logged and alerted
- Structured logging for security monitoring

## Usage

### Upload Validation
```python
from app.utils.file_validation import validate_upload

try:
    validate_upload(file, user_id=current_user.id)
except ValueError as e:
    return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
```

### With Virus Scanning (Production)
```python
from app.utils.virus_scan import validate_upload_with_virus_scan

try:
    validate_upload_with_virus_scan(file, user_id=current_user.id)
except ValueError as e:
    return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
```

### Serving Files
```html
<!-- Use authenticated endpoint -->
<img src="/api/files/{{ filename }}" alt="Secure file">
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
pytest Project-root/tests/test_file_validation.py -v
```

## Production Checklist

- [x] python-magic installed
- [x] System libmagic installed (Linux/macOS)
- [x] Strict file validation enabled
- [x] Files stored outside static/
- [x] Authenticated file serving implemented
- [x] Logging configured
- [ ] Virus scanning enabled (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Log monitoring configured
- [ ] Alerts configured for virus detections

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `app/utils/file_validation.py` - Core validation logic
- `app/utils/virus_scan.py` - Optional virus scanning
- `app/api/file_routes.py` - Authenticated file serving
- `tests/test_file_validation.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `VIRUS_SCANNING_GUIDE.md` - Virus scanning setup guide

### Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Added python-magic==0.4.27
- `README.md` - Documented system dependencies
- `app/__init__.py` - Registered file_routes blueprint
- `app/utils/__init__.py` - Export validate_upload
- `app/utils.py` - Removed legacy validation
- `app/api/routes.py` - Updated upload logic (2 locations)
- `app/main/routes.py` - Updated profile upload logic

## Key Security Improvements

1. **No execution without validation** - python-magic is mandatory
2. **Magic number enforcement** - File content verified, not just extension
3. **Secure storage** - Files outside web root with restricted permissions
4. **Access control** - All file access authenticated and authorized
5. **Audit trail** - Complete logging of all upload and access attempts
6. **Virus scanning** - Optional ClamAV integration for production
7. **No polyglots** - Magic number must match MIME type
8. **Size limits** - Configurable per-upload size restrictions

## Migration Notes

- Old `validate_upload()` in `app/utils.py` removed
- New import: `from app.utils.file_validation import validate_upload`
- All uploads now raise ValueError instead of returning (bool, str)
- Update error handling to use try/except instead of if/else
- Files moved from `static/uploads` to `private_uploads`
- Update templates to use `/api/files/` instead of `/static/uploads/`
