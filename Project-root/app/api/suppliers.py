# [BUG FIX] Removed stub implementation of get_suppliers() that was returning empty data=[]
# The full implementation exists in routes.py with proper supplier data
# This stub was overriding the real implementation and causing empty supplier lists

# This file is kept for future supplier-specific endpoints if needed
