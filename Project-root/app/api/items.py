# [BUG FIX] Removed stub implementation of get_items() that was returning empty data=[]
# The full implementation exists in routes.py with proper pagination, filters, and data format
# This stub was overriding the real implementation and causing "Failed to load inventory items" error

# This file is kept for future item-specific endpoints if needed
